# Memory Downloader
Memory Downloader downloads different executable files to memory and then runs them, without them touching the HDD/SSD.
This means as long as this software is not detected by an AntiVirus, neither should the executed files be.

##### Features Include:
- Downloading and running multiple files
- Running files embedded in the program resources (more detections, doesn't require internet though)
